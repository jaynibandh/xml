    <?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
    <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a method for planning the spreading of a spreading material mixture according to the preamble of patent claim <b>1</b>.</p>
    <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Spreading material mixtures with a plurality of individual components, such as, for example, fertilizer mixtures that contain several individual fertilizers, are enjoying increasing popularity, since the time and personnel required for spreading the spreading material can be considerably reduced by the simultaneous spreading of several individual components. In practice, however, it has been shown that it is not always possible to apply individual components of a spreading mixture together, so that it is often impossible, upon applying the corresponding spreading mixtures, to avoid misapplication of individual or all components of the spreading mixtures. The misapplications result, for example, in a non-uniform distribution of individual or all components of the spreading material mixture on the agricultural land.</p>
    <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Until now there is no method known In the prior art, with which the application of a spreading material mixture with an agricultural spreading machine can be reliably planned.</p>
    <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object, the present invention is based on, is therefore the capability of assessing the joint spreadability of individual components of a spreading material mixture for planning a spreading operation better than has been possible to date.</p>
    <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object is solved by a method of the type mentioned at the beginning, wherein component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreading machine are first determined for a planned spreading operation for several or all individual components of the spreading material mixture. Subsequently, an evaluation of the joint spreadability of the individual components of the spreading material mixture is carried out on the basis of the determined component-related setting parameters by a calculation device.</p>
    <p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention takes advantage of the knowledge that component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreading machine may be readily determined for the respective individual components of the spreading material mixture, wherein the joint spreadability of the individual components of the spreading material mixture can be reliably assessed by comparing the component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreading machine of the individual components.</p>
    <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The calculation device is preferably a data processing device. The method may be at least partially or entirely a computer-implemented method.</p>
    <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The spreading material mixture may be a fertilizer mixture, in which case the individual components of the spreading material mixture are preferably individual fertilizers. The component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreader preferably relate to component-related ejection angles, component-related setting values for the feed point of the individual component onto the spreading disc, component-related throwing distances and/or component-related spreading disc speeds for the planned spreading operation. Furthermore, the component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreading machine may relate to component-related opening sizes, opening shapes and/or opening positions of a spreading material feed opening of the agricultural spreading machine for the planned spreading operation. Alternatively or additionally, the component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreading machine may relate to component-related blade positions, blade inclinations, blade orientations and/or blade lengths of one or more throwing blades of the spreading disc of the agricultural spreading machine for the planned spreading operation, if the spreading is to be carried out via spreading discs with throwing blades. Furthermore, the component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreading machine may relate to component-related chute inclinations, chute orientations and/or chute positions for the planned spreading operation, if the spreading material is to be guided via a feed chute of the agricultural spreading machine for spreading. Alternatively or additionally, the component-related setting parameters for the agricultural spreader may relate to component-related spreading disc types, component-related spreading disc geometries and/or component-related throwing blade types. The planned spreading operation preferably specifies the operational width to be maintained.</p>

The calculation device is preferably a component of a central computer system, the electronic device or the agricultural spreading machine. For determining the component-related setting parameters, component-related spreading data is preferably retrieved from a database, in particular from a spreading database. The retrieval of the component-related spreading data can be performed via the calculation device.
