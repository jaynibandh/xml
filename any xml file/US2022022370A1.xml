    <p id="p-0007" num="0006">As far as known, there are no lawn mower small, mower deck mounted mechanical diverters or accessory warning devices for diverting and saving honeybees and other endangered insects or similar devices. It is believed that this product is unique in its design and technologies.</p>
    <heading id="h-0007" level="1">Background</heading>
    <p id="p-0008" num="0007">This background as to bees and their habitats and customs should be useful in understanding the importance of the small, mower deck mounted mechanical diverters or accessory warning devices for diverting and saving honeybees and other endangered insects. Bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects, birds, and bats, most of which is accomplished by bees, whether wild or domesticated. From 1972 to 2006, feral honeybees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and <i>Varroa </i>mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus <i>Nosema ceranae </i>were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Apart from colony collapse disorder, losses outside the US have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees may face increased risk of extinction because of global warming. Finally, the White Dutch clover has been added to grass seed, commercially sold in America, last several decades is preferred over naturally growing clover here. It keeps broadleaf weeds reduced or “down better”. These are large White Dutch clover area are killing zones. In the last 10 years various studies have indicated a decline worldwide where clover is, and these zero turn mowers are sold. The mowers are a main problem in the reduction of bee population.</p>
    <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honeybee, for producing honey and beeswax. The three types of honeybees in a hive are: queens (egg-producers), workers (non-reproducing females), and drones (males whose main duty is to find and mate with a queen). Solitary bees are important pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. They are found on every continent except <i>Antarctica </i>and in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. Some species including honeybees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most bees are polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants; however, some are oligolectic (bee specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees can sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honeybees.</p>
    <p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bees see all colors except the color red. That and their sense of smell help them find the flowers they need to collect pollen. Not only is pollen a food source for bees, but also some of the pollen is dropped in flight, resulting in cross pollination. The relationship between the plant and the insect is called symbiosis. A bee has a pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes (ocelli) which provide information for the bee on light intensity. The antennae usually have thirteen segments in males and twelve in females and are geniculate, having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste, and small, hair-like mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement to “hear” sounds. The mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar.</p>
    <p id="p-0011" num="0010">Often Beekeepers use smoke to calm bees when they are collecting honey or relocating a hive. Noise and acoustic sounds can impact bee behavior. In D'Arcy Thompson's translation: “At early dawn they make no noise, until someone particular bee makes a buzzing noise two or three times and thereby awakes the rest; hereupon they all fly in a body to work. By and by they return and at first are noisy; . . . until at last someone bee flies round about, making a buzzing noise, and apparently calling on the others to go to sleep”.</p>
    <heading id="h-0008" level="2">Problem Solved</heading>
    <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The last 10 years have noticed decline worldwide where clover is, and these zero turn mowers are sold. The improvement and problem solved as to bee population is to provide a small, mower deck mounted mechanical diverters or accessory warning devices for diverting and saving honeybees and other endangered insects. Alternative means to alert such as sound, light, and electromagnetic forces are also anticipated as a solution to killing the bees with the fast mowers of today.</p>
    <heading id="h-0009" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-0013" num="0012">This invention is a Lawn mower Diverter/Bee Guard or accessory warning device for diverting and saving honeybees and other endangered insects. Alternative mechanical designs and light, sound, electro-magnetic force, and spray devices are shown as alternative embodiments.</p>
    <p id="p-0014" num="0013">The preferred embodiment of a lawn mower diverter or accessory warning device for diverting and saving honeybees and other endangered insects is comprised of: an accessory warning device configured as a long plate diverter guard for diverting and saving a group of pollinating honeybees and other endangered insects, the long plate diverter guard being mounted to a front vertical drop of a deck of a mower, being made of durable materials, and being comprised of a. a vertical face with a front surface and a back surface the vertical face having at least two aperture to accept a means for removably fastening the long plate diverter guard to mower deck; b. a horizontal face with a top surface and bottom surface; c. a kick-up angle feature; and d. the vertical face, horizontal face, and kick-up angle feature being a continual thickness wherein the warning device alerts the pollinating bees of the oncoming mower by spreading the grass and deflecting a body of the pollinating bee so the bees can survive by flying away and averting their demise by the mower. Alternative devices for warning are sound, light, smoke, spray, and Electro Magnetic force/pulse generators placed with the mowers.</p>
    <p id="p-0015" num="0014">The newly invented Lawn mower Diverter/Bee Guard or accessory warning device for diverting and saving honeybees and other endangered insects can be manufactured at low volumes by very simple means and in high volume production by more complex and controlled systems.</p>

      <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref> A and <b>10</b> B are a sketch of the color spectrum and human versus bee vision plus a comparison sound/hearing chart. Shown are a bee vision vs human vision chart <b>75</b> and a bee hearing vs other animal hearing chart <b>78</b>. As to color and light, objects, including living organisms, emit energy as electromagnetic radiation (heat) and light. The full range of wavelengths, extending from gamma rays to long radio waves, is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. Colors that humans see are only a very small part of the light spectrum. Humans base their color combinations on red, blue, and green, while bees base their colors on ultraviolet light, blue and green. This is the reason why bees can't see the color red. They don't have a photoreceptor for it. They can, however, see reddish wavelengths, such as yellow and orange. They can also see blue-green, blue, violet, and “bee's purple.” Bee's purple is a combination of yellow and ultraviolet light. That's why humans can't see it. The most likely colors to attract. bees, according to scientists, are purple, violet, and blue. Bees also can see color much faster than humans. Their color vision is the fastest in the animal world-five times faster than humans. The remarkable eyesight of bees has long been a source of fascination in the scientific community. A hundred years ago, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Karl von Frisch proved that bees could see color. The color humans see is based upon how a pigment absorbs and reflects light. When light hits an object, some is absorbed and some is reflected. Our eyes perceive the reflected portion as color. The brilliant color in flowers is a way of attracting pollinators, such as bees. The colors of flowers help target the areas of nectar. That's the reason why petals are usually a different color than leaves. Even though humans can see more colors, bees have a much broader range of color vision. Their ability to see ultraviolet light gives them an advantage when seeking nectar. Many patterns on flowers are invisible to humans. These nectar “bulls-eyes” are visible only to animals, such as bees, that can see ultra-violet light. This “bee vision” makes finding nectar much easier. In fact, some flowers such as sunflowers, primroses and pansies have nectar guides that can only be seen in ultra-violet light. Bees can sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields.</p>
    <p id="p-0050" num="0054">As to sounds, bees house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste, and small, hair like mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement to “hear” sounds. The hearing property of human ear is limited. Human ear can perceive sound within a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The sound frequency below 20 Hz is Infrasonic sound and above 20 kHz is Ultrasonic (US) sound. Human ear Ls not sensitive to US because the eardrum. cannot vibrate as fast as US. Ultrasound has high frequency, so the wave is very powerful. US travel along straight line even in the presence of obstacles. When the US hits an object, it bends and round and spread in all directions.</p>

This is shown as the spreadsheet table “Tests trial results” <b>160</b> of experiments using the long plate diverter guard <b>130</b> to see how many bees <b>88</b> are diverted. This type of testing was observed by a USDA writer, Dr. Jay Evans who is chief scientist Honeybee research programs Beltsville Md. USDA. He recently stated: “I will end with a story for the future that has sucked me in despite being way out of my scientific wheelhouse. First, it is undeniable that bees of all sorts do better with fields of flowers than fields of turf. For bee fans, the 50+ million acres of turf in the U.S. (https://agamerica.com/turfgrass-industries/) represent a blank canvas. Turf ranks among the top three U.S. ‘crops’, with soybeans and corn. As with soy and corn, tapping into the turf environment by making it more bee friendly would be a really big deal. Many property owners seem quite satisfied with a turf lawn but others, given a nudge, would rather turn their lawns into a more functional space by supporting bees and other wildlife. So called ‘bee lawns’, with a little effort, can be beautiful and enriching for honeybees and other beneficial insects (https://www.beelab.umn.edu/learn-more/beelawn). Most lawns, with small changes in mowing and herbicide behavior, will support white clover and other flowers for much of the year. Mr. Steve Hess, of Indiana, runs his own environmentally focused pest control business. He is an entomologist who walks the fine line between removing pest insects and protecting his beloved bees. He was acutely aware that his highspeed commercial lawnmower was mulching numerous bees, and there was no way that either he or his bees could avoid collisions. Knowing the turf stats above, he also calculated the country-wide bee losses due to lawn maintenance and was appalled. Mr. Hess' conscience and creativity have led to one possible solution. He has invented a cattle guard of sorts for riding mowers, meant to gently lift bees above the mower deck just before they are sucked into the blades. He and his engineering partners continue to improve the details, but a patented model that we have both tested seems durable and likely to save some bee lives. The testing protocol consists of strapping a video camera in front of the deck and mowing fields of clover with and without the guides. Despite many acres of footage, and one mulched iPhone, it is surprisingly hard to quantify how many bees take flight versus drop to the turf and under a mower deck. Still, we have seen enough of the latter, and enough improvement with the guides, to indicate that this will be a great holiday present for landscapers and bee lovers someday. Mr. Hess remains passionate about this and is one of the hardest working people I have met. If you would like to learn more about these ‘Bee Guards’, you can contact Mr. Hess directly. So . . . go out there with optimism and realism and double your honey this year, or at least plant some flowers and mind the bees.”</p>
